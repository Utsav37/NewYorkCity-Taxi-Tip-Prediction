# NYC Taxi Tip Prediction - Predict Tip for any ride in New York City
Dataset: We will use datacollected by the New York City Taxi and Limousine commission about “Green” Taxis. Green Taxis (as opposed to yellow ones) are taxis that are not allowed to pick up passengers inside of the densely populated areas of Manhattan. We will use the data from September 2015. We are using NYC Taxi and Limousine trip record data: (http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml).
